ðŸ—ƒ :code:`para`
====================

.. image:: assets/para.png

What?
-----

An example decoder and utility for Flipnote Studios :code:`.ppm` animation format.

Why this over that?
-------------------

This implementation is

- `SIGNIFICANTLY faster <#speed>`_
- implemented in safe Rust (a language with strict type-checking!)
- being actively updated

Speed
^^^^^

In a two-hundred-forty-four frame :code:`.ppm` benchmark running the command
:code:`$ para ./benchmark.ppm gif benchmark.gif` on a twelve-core,
twenty-four-thread Ryzen 9 processor, para took an average of 603.3459 milliseconds,
while ppm-parser took an average of 50.4171397 seconds.

Running the command :code:`$ para ./benchmark.ppm 0 benchmark.png` on a twelve-core,
twenty-four-thread Ryzen 9 processor, para took an average of 8.9794 milliseconds,
while ppm-parser took an average of 358.2232 milliseconds.

Rust versus Python isn't very fair, however, this benchmark shows the speed improvements
that para brings to the table.

Getting up and Running
----------------------

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Prebuilt binaries for x86_64-based Linux systems and Windows are available in the
`releases <https://github.com/Usugata/para/releases/latest>`_. If you are using
a different operating system or architecture such as macOS, you'll have to build and
install the tool yourself!

.. code-block:: shell

  $ cargo install --git https://github.com/Usugata/para --branch main

If you are building and installing yourself, you must have
`Rust <https://www.rust-lang.org/>`_ installed!

Usage
^^^^^

.. code-block:: shell

  usage:  para <in> <index option> <out>
  index options:
          gif
          thumb
          dump
          integer(u16)

Examples
^^^^^^^^

- :code:`$ para ./example.ppm 23 example.png` will output the twenty-fourth frame
  of :code:`example.ppm` to :code:`example.png`
- :code:`$ para ./example.ppm thumb example.png` will output the thumbnail of
  :code:`example.ppm` to :code:`example.png`
- :code:`$ para ./example.ppm dump example.json` will output the metadata of
  :code:`example.ppm` to :code:`example.json`
- :code:`$ para ./example.ppm gif example.gif` will output :code:`example.ppm`
  to :code:`example.gif`
